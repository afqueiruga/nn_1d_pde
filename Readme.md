# Solving 1D PDEs with Neural Networks

We can design neural networks that look like existing numerical models:

and there's opportunity to use them to learn better complicated numerical schemes than we can design by hand. However, I'm not fully confident that they'd gives us exactly the right answer, so I tested that out on the easiest problems I could find.

The initial work was submitted to the machine learning and physical sciences workshop at NeurIPS. The paper can be found under (paper/neurips_2019.tex)[paper/neurips_2019.tex]. Expanding to the other papers

## Methodology

We use analytical solutions to generate datasets for the following equations:

1. The Heat Equation: Linear Parabolic
1. The Poisson Equation: Linear Elliptic
1. The Wave Equation: Linear Hyperbolic
1. Burger's Equation: Nonlinear conservative with shocks
1. Kortewegâ€“de Vries (KdV) equation: Nonlinear with solitons
1. The Euler-Bernouli Beam Equation: Linear, biharmonic

The code to make the datasets is [analytical_solutions.ipynb](analytical_solutions.ipynb), and the outputs are .npz files in [data/](data).
Most of the analytical solutions are taken in the `detest` testing framework should you wish to generate more data (or test a PDE solver.) 

## Hypotheses:

1. The 3-parameter convolution layer will learn the expected weights
   with standard training techniques. **true**
1. Purely advsererial training will work but slowly: **negative result**
1. Adding adverserial training will improve stability **invalidated by
   2**
1. Need 2 history snapshots for the wave equation *todo*
1. Parameter-bottleneck autoencoder will not generalize to multiple
   trajectories *todo*
1. The CFL condition dictates connectivity and stability of the
   networks; need a U-net or a fully connected model for the heat
   equation and poisson equation. *todo*
