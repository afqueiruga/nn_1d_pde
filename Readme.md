# Solving 1D PDEs with Neural Networks

Alejandro Francisco Queiruga

We use analytical solutions to generate datasets for the following equations:

1. The Heat Equation: Linear Parabolic
1. The Poisson Equation: Linear Elliptic
1. The Wave Equation: Linear Hyperbolic
1. Burger's Equation: Nonlinear conservative with shocks
1. Kortewegâ€“de Vries (KdV) equation: Nonlinear with solitons
1. The Euler-Bernouli Beam Equation: Linear, biharmonic

The analytical solutions are all included in the `detest` testing framework should you wish to generate more data (or test a PDE solver.)
